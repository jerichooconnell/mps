PyPPM
===============================

Tools for accessing and visualising PPMstar data.

PyPPM has been developed, and is maintained and supported by the NuGrid collaboration. Feedback and input from the community is welcome. Examples of PyPPM in action can be tried out on the `astrohub <https://astrohub.uvic.ca/>`_ server. PyPPM uses the future package so that it can be used with both python 2 and 3.

These modules were written with an interactive work mode in mind, in particular taking advantage of the interactive ipython session or inside an jupyter notebook.
