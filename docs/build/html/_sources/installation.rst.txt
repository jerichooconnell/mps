Installation
================

PyPPM is intended to be run on the astrohub server

`astrohub <https://astrohub.uvic.ca/>`_

astrohub contains a copy of ppmpy with all of the dependancies and data.

Download
----------------

To download you own copy go to PPMstar on 

`github <https://github.com/PPMstar/PyPPM/releases/>`_

Dependancies
----------------

* `numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_.
* `scipy <https://www.scipy.org/>`_.
* `nugridpy <https://nugrid.github.io/NuGridPy/>`_.
* `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`_.

As well as rprofile.py which can be found on the astrohub server in /data/ppm_rpod2/lib/lcse

Data Assumptions
==================

Yprofile files Assumptions
--------------------------

- labeled as YProfile-01-xxxx.bobaaa and the xxxx is the NDump that is
  located within each file.

- There can be a maximum of 9999 files in each directory.  The first 10
  lines of each file are the only place where header data is uniquely
  located.

- Header data is separated by five spaces and line breaks.

- An attribute cant be in the form of a number, ie if the user is able
  to 'float(attribute)' (in python) without an error attribute will not
  be returned.

- A row of column Names or Cycle Names is preceded and followed by a
  blank line.

- A block of data values are preceded and followed by a blank line
  except the last data block in the file, where it is not followed by a
  blank line.

- In the YProfile file, if a line of attributes contains the attribute
  Ndump, then that line of attributes and any other following lines of
  attributes in the file are cycle attributes.

Header Attribute Assumptions
----------------------------

- Header attributes are separated by lines and instances of four spaces
  (    )

- Header attribute come in one of below here are things that do stuff
  with the data 6 types.

- The first type is the first attribute in the file. It is formatted in
  such a way that the name of the attribute is separated from its
  associated data with an equals sign ex.
  Stellar Conv. Luminosity =  1.61400E-02 x 10^43 ergs,

- The second type is when an attribute contains the sub string 'grid;'.
  It is formatted in such a way such that there are 3 numerical values
  separated by 'x' which are then followed by the string ' grid;' ex.
  384 x 384 x 384 grid;

- The third type is were name of the attribute is separated from its
  associated data with an equals sign.  Also that data may be followed
  by a unit of measurement. ex.
  Thickness (Mm) of heating shell =  1.00000E+00

- The fourth type is when an attribute contains a colon.  The String
  before the colon is the title of the attribute.  After the colon there
  is a list of n sub attributes, each with a sub title, and separated by
  its value with an equals sign.  Aslo each sub attribute is separated
  by a comma ex.
  At base of the convection zone:  R =  9.50000E+00,  g =  4.95450E-01,
  rho =  1.17400E+01,  p =  1.69600E+01

- The fifth is when an attribute starts with 'and'.  after the and, the
  next word after has to be the same as one word contained in the
  previous attribute ex.
  and of transition from convection to stability =  5.00000E-01  at
  R =  3.00000E+01 Mm.

- The sixth is when there is a string or attribute title followed by two
  spaces followed by one value followed by two spaces followed by an
  'and' which is then followed by a second Value ex.
  Gravity turns on between radii   6.00000E+00  and   7.00000E+00  Mm.
